## 3. Data Comparison Analysis

### Tipping Behavior by Customer Segments

**Gender Comparison:**
- Male customers: Average tip $3.09
- Female customers: Average tip $2.83
- Difference primarily attributed to higher bill amounts rather than generosity
- No statistically significant difference in tip percentages

**Smoking Status Comparison:**
- Smokers: Average tip $3.01
- Non-smokers: Average tip $2.97
- No significant difference in tipping behavior (p-value > 0.05)

**Day of Week Analysis:**
- **Highest Tips:** Sunday ($3.26 average)
- **Lowest Tips:** Thursday ($2.77 average)
- Weekend days show consistently higher absolute tips
- Statistical significance confirmed (ANOVA p-value < 0.05)

**Service Time Comparison:**
- **Dinner:** Average tip $3.10
- **Lunch:** Average tip $2.73
- Dinner customers tip 13.5% more on average
- Correlation with higher dinner bill amounts

*[Insert Figure 6: Tip Percentage Comparison Charts]*

### Statistical Significance Testing
- Gender differences: Not statistically significant (p > 0.05)
- Smoking status: No significant difference (p > 0.05)
- Day of week: Statistically significant variation (p < 0.05)
- Service time: Significant difference (p < 0.05)

## 4. Data Relationship Analysis

### Correlation Analysis

**Strong Positive Relationships:**
- **Total Bill ↔ Tip Amount:** r = 0.676 (Strong)
  - For every $10 increase in bill, tip increases by approximately $1.83
  - Highly significant relationship (p < 0.001)

- **Party Size ↔ Total Bill:** r = 0.598 (Moderate-Strong)
  - Larger parties generate proportionally higher bills
  - Each additional person adds approximately $7.44 to the bill

**Interesting Inverse Relationships:**
- **Total Bill ↔ Tip Percentage:** r = -0.203 (Weak Negative)
  - Higher bills receive slightly lower tip percentages
  - Customers may tip a flat amount rather than strict percentage

**Moderate Relationships:**
- **Party Size ↔ Tip Amount:** r = 0.489 (Moderate)
  - Larger groups tip more in absolute terms
  - Relationship mediated through bill amount

### Advanced Relationship Patterns

**Multi-variable Analysis:**
- Dinner customers show stronger bill-to-tip correlation than lunch
- Male customers at dinner generate highest absolute tips
- Weekend parties of 3+ show premium tipping behavior
- Smoking status shows no interaction effects with other variables

**Categorical Variable Associations:**
- Gender and smoking status: Independent (χ² p > 0.05)
- Day and time: Significant association (χ² p < 0.001)
- Time preferences vary by day of week
